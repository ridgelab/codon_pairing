Codon Pairing Motifs 
By: Justin Miller and Lauren McKinnon
Email: justin.miller@uky.edu

##########################

Purpose: Recover a Phylogeny with Codon Pairing and Compare it to The Open Tree of Life.
The pipeline for both the alignment-free and parsimony-based approaches are listed.

##########################
Alignment-free
##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

See requirements in README (in 'alignment_free' directory) and README_getOTLtree (in 'other_scripts' directory)

##########################

Step 1:
Move all coding sequences (CDS) in FASTA format into a directory, one for each species. 
Each fasta file should be in the format {species_name}{.gz}, with the .gz being used if the file is gzipped.
An example of a directory with correctly formatted CDS files is in the test/mammals/ directory.

Step 2:
Create a Distance Matrix using pairing_distance.py (in 'alignment_free' directory)
Examples of possible ways to do this are in the README (in 'alignment_free' directory). 
The recommended method is:
python alignment_free/pairing_distance.py -id testfiles/mammals_small/ -o output

Step 3:
Recover a phylogeny using the distance matrix.
We provide a script to recover a phylogeny using BioPython, makeNewick.py.
python other_scripts/makeNewick.py -i output -o output.nwk

Step 4:
Infer the phylogeny of these species from the Open Tree of Life.
See README_getOTLtree (in 'other_scripts') for more information.
The recommended method is:
python other_scripts/getOTLtree.py -i output.nwk  -o OTL.nwk -e

Step 5:
Compare the recovered phylogeny using cam.py with the Open Tree of Life.
This optional step requires the ETE toolkit (http://etetoolkit.org/download/)
The command we use to compare the trees is:
ete3 compare -t output.nwk -r OTL.nwk --unrooted
The columns with -br+ show the percent similarity between the recovered phylogeny
and the Open Tree of Life.


##########################
Parsimony
##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

See requirements in README_parsimony_pairing (in 'parsimony' directory) and README_getOTLtree (in 'other_scripts' directory)

##########################
Step 1:
Move all coding sequences (CDS) in FASTA format into a directory, one for each species. 
Each fasta file should be in the format {species_name}{.gz}, with the .gz being used if the file is gzipped.
An example of a directory with correctly formatted CDS files is in the testfiles/mammals_small/ directory.

Step 2:
Create a character matrix of parsimony informative codons pairs using parsimony_pairing.py in 'parsimony' directory).
Examples of possible ways to do this are in the README_parsimony_pairing file (in 'parsimony' directory).
The recommended method is:
python parsimony/parsimony_pairing -id testfiles/mammals_small/ -o mammals_matrix.txt -oc mammals_characters.txt

Step 3:
Recover a phylogeny using the character matrix created in Step 2.
We provide a Tree Analysis Using New Technology (TNT) script to do this, codonPairingTNTRunfile.tnt (in 'parsimony' directory).
This step requires TNT (http://www.zmuc.dk/public/phylogeny/tnt/)
The TNT command we use to run the TNT script is:
./tnt proc codonPairingTNTRunfile.tnt ;

Step 4:
Infer the phylogeny of these species from the Open Tree of Life.
See README_getOTLtree (in 'other_scripts') for more information.
The recommended method is:
python other_scripts/getOTLtree.py -i output.nwk  -o OTL.nwk -e

Step 5:
Compare the recovered phylogeny using cam.py with the Open Tree of Life.
This optional step requires the ETE toolkit (http://etetoolkit.org/download/)
The command we use to compare the trees is:
ete3 compare -t output.nwk -r OTL.nwk --unrooted
The columns with -br+ show the percent similarity between the recovered phylogeny
and the Open Tree of Life. For clades that recovered multiple maximum parsimony trees, we find the mean 
comparison of all the trees. Further instructions can be found in 'parsimony/comparisons' directory.
