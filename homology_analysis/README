##########################

Purpose: Calculate retention index of identical codon pairing,co-tRNA pairing, or combined pairing. Compare to random permutations.

##########################


REQUIREMENTS:

These scripts use Python version 3.5 and R.

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. os
3. numpy
4. random

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip3 install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.

R libraries that must be installed include:
1. readr
2. ggplot2

If any of these libraries is not install, use the following commands in the R console:
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")

PIPELINE - example

Step 1: Prepare state change files
Use the output matrix and character files from the parsimony_pairing directory in getHomology.py.
python3 getHomology.py test_files/mammals_cotrna_matrix.txt test_files/mammals_cotrna_chars.txt mammals_cotrna_homology


Step 2: Score the state change against the Open Tree of Life.
This script was adapted from Miller et. al (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106697) and is included here for convenience.
python3 codon_congruence/scoreCharactersOnTree.py -c test_files/mammals_cotrna_homology -r test_files/mammal_ref.nwk -o mammal_state_change


Step 3: Calculate the retention index
python3 calcActualRI.py test_files/mammal_state_change mammal_RI mammals_RIs.csv


#Compare these results to random permutations
Step 4: Create random permutations of the Open Tree of Life
python3 makeRandom.py test_files/mammals_ref.nwk mammal_perms.nwk


Step 5: Score the state change against random permutations
mkdir mammal_perms
python3 codon_congruence/scoreCharactersOnTree.py -c test_files/mammals_cotrna_homology -r test_files/mammal_perms.nwk -o mammal_perms


Step 6: Calculate retention indices for each state change file
python3 calcRetentionIndex.py mammal_perms mammal_summary.csv


Step 7: Make the figure
Rscript permutations_RI.R test_files/mammal_summary.csv mammal.pdf "Mammal"
