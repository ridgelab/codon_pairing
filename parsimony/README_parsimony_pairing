Purpose: Compare identical codon pairing,co-tRNA pairing, or combined pairing between species. Create a TNT formatted file of the
matrix of species relationships.

REQUIREMENTS:

parsimony_pairingMatrix.py uses Python version 3.5

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. os
2. argparse
3. re
4. Process, current_process, freeze_support, and Pool from multiprocessing

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip3 install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.

Input Directory:
This algorithm requires as input either a single Fasta file of the coding sequences of a species
	or a directory which contains multiple Fasta files.

Output File:
An output matrix file is required. Output character and output names files
	are optional.

##########################

USAGE:

Typical usage requires the -id option.
The algorithm will use calculate the identical codon pairing, co-tRNA pairing, or combined pairing for each of the input files.
	A codon is defined to be in pairing if it is located within the ribosomal
	footprint window of an identical codon. The algorithm will compare the pairing between orthologs of different species. If a species contains a codon
	that is found in pairing, it will be assigned a value of "1" in the matrix. If it is not found in pairing, it will be assigned a value
	of "0". If the species does not have the codon for that given gene, it will be assigned a "?" in the matrix. This algorithm will
	consider only codons that are parsimony informative. That is, they must be found in at least 4 species and they must be found with 
	both a "0" and "1" in at least one species respectively. This algorithm also will include only species that are found to contain 
	at least 5% of these informative codons.

Example input directory:
	See the example directory called mammals (located in the 'testFiles' directory).
	
By default, the algorithm computes the pairing matrix given a ribosomal window size of 9 codons.
	This behavior may be modified using the "-f" option followed by the number of codons that 
	the ribosome spans.

By default, the algorithm computes the matrix using identical codon pairing. To perform the analysis using co-tRNA pairing, include
	the "-c" option. To perform the analysis for combined pairing, include the "-comb" option.

By default, the program accepts as input Fasta files of DNA coding sequences. To perform the analysis
	using RNA, include the "-rna" option.

By default, the program runs using all available cores. The "-t" option may be used to specify the
	number of cores the program will use.

Example usage:
python parsimony_pairing.py -id testFiles/mammals -o mammals_matrix -f 4
python parsimony_pairing.py -id testFiles/mammals -c -o mammals_cotrna_matrix.txt -oc mammals_chars.txt 
python parsimony_pairing.py -id testFiles/mammals -comb -o mammals_cotrna_matrix.txt -on mammals_names.txt

Running the first of the above commands will produce an output file for the species matrix based on identical codon pairing in a ribosomal window
	of size 4.

Running the second of the above commands will produce an output file for the species matrix based on co-tRNA codon pairing. It will also produce
	an output file of the parsimonary informative characters that were used.

Running the third of the above commands will produce an output file for the species matrix based on combined codon pairing. It will use a numbered system to name the species.
	It will produce an output file for the key of file names to assigned species name.
