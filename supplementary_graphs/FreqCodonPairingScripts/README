CALCULATE FREQUENCY OF CODON PAIRING:

The directory FreqCodonPairingScripts contains the tools to calculate the frequency that each codon is paired within all genes
of a clade. These scripts will produce a graph showing a boxplot for each codon, where each boxplot represents the 
distribution of the percent frequency of the codon pairing for each species.

Step 1:
Run makeCodonPairingInputFile.py with the path of the input file as the first argument and the path of the output file
to be created as the second argument. The following command shows an example of how to use this program.

python makeCodonPairingInputFile.py ../mammals mammals_codonFreq.txt

Step 2:
Create the graph using freqCodonPairing_rscript.R
This program showed be run using 3 arguments:
1 - The path to the input file
2 - The path to the output file
3 - The name of the clade (which will be used in the title)

The following command shows how to run this script.
