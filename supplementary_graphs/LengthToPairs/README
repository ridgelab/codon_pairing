INPUT:

The input for this script is a directory of pairing files made using the program in the parsimony_pairing directory.
For example input see ../test_mammals.

CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF CODON PAIRS COMPARED TO THE LENGTH OF THE GENE 

These scripts will produce a scatterplot with a linear regression showing the number of codon pairs compared to the length of the gene.


Step 1:
Run makePairsToLength.py with the path of the input file as the first argument and the path of the output file
to be created as the second argument. The following command shows an example of how to use this program.


python makePairsToLength.py ../test_mammals/dna/ CSVs/mammals_dna.csv
python makePairsToLength.py ../test_mammals/cotrna/ CSVs/mammals_cotrna.csv
python makePairsToLength.py ../test_mammals/combined/ CSVs/mammals_combined.csv


Step 2:
Create the graph using pairingLengthGraph.R
This program showed be run using 3 arguments:
1 - The path to the input Co-tRNA file
2 - The path to the input DNA file
3 - The path to the input Combined file
4 - The name of the clade (which will be used in the title)
5 - Output file name

The following command shows how to run this script.
Rscript pairingLengthGraph.R CSVs/mammals_cotrna.csv CSVs/mammals_dna.csv CSVs/mammals_combined.csv Mammals mammals.pdf
