CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF CODON PAIRS IN MOTIFS

The directory NumCodonsInMotifs contains the tools to calculate the number of codons that each motifs contains. The scripts will
create a graph showing the the number of codons in a motif on the x-axis related to the number of different motifs that use that
number of codons on the y-axis.

Step 1:

Run makeNumCodonsInputFile.py with the path of the input file as the first argument and the path of the output file
to be created as the second argument. The following command shows an example of how to use this program.

python makeNumCodonsInputFile.py ../mammals mammals_numCodons.txt

Step 2:
Create the graph using numCodonPairs_rscript.R
This program showed be run using 3 arguments:
1 - The path to the input file
2 - The path to the output file
3 - The name of the clade (which will be used in the title)

The following command shows how to run this script.

Rscript numCodonPairs_rscript.R mammals_numCodons.txt mammals_numCodons.png Mammals
