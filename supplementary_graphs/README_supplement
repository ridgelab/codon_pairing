Purpose: Analyze the codon pairing motifs in all genes of a given clade. Create graphs to represent
	this data.

##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

These tools use Python version 3 and R.

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. math

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.


These tools also use R.

R libraries that must be installed include:
1. readr
2. ggplot2
3. grid
4. gridExtra

If any of those libraries are not installed, use the following commands in the R console:
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("grid")
install.packages("gridExtra")

##########################

INPUT:

The input for these scripts (unless otherwise specified) is a file containing the codon pairing motifs (i.e. the set of codons that paired
within a gene). The input file includes a species name followed by a codon pairing motif followed by the number of genes
in the species that used that motif. For an example input, see the mammals file in this directory.
