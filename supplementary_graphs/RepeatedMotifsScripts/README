CALCULATE THE FREQUENCY OF REPEATED MOTIFS

The directory FreqRepeatedMotifsScripts contains the tools to calculate the number of times a motifs is repeated. The scripts produce
a graph that shows on the x-axis the number of times a motif is repeated, and the y-axis shows the number of motifs.

Step 1:

Run makeRepeatedMotifsFile.py with the path of the input file as the first argument and the path of the output file
to be created as the second argument. The following command shows an example of how to use this program.

python makeRepeatedMotifsFile.py ../mammals mammals_repeatedMotifs.txt

Step 2:
Create the graph using repeatedMotifs_rscript.R
This program showed be run using 3 arguments:
1 - The path to the input file
2 - The path to the output file
3 - The name of the clade (which will be used in the title)

The following command shows how to run this script.

Rscript repeatedMotifs_rscript.R mammals_repeatedMotifs.txt mammals_repeatedMotifs.png Mammals
