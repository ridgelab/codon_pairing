INPUT:

The input for this script is the distance matrices created in the alignment_free directory. 
For example input see mammal_files.

CALCULATE THE SATURATION OF PAIRING DISTANCES 

This script will produce a graph where each line represents the distance from one species to its nearest neighbors.


Create the graph using saturation_args.R
This program showed be run using 3 arguments:
1 - The path to the input Co-tRNA distance matrix
2 - The path to the input DNA distance matrix
3 - The path to the input Combined distance matrix
4 - The name of the clade (which will be used in the title)
5 - Output file name

The following command shows how to run this script.
Rscript saturation_args.R mammal_files/aa_9 mammal_files/dna_9 mammal_files/combined_9 Mammals mammals.pdf
