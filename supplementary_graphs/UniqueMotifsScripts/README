CALCULATE UNIQUE VS. REPEATED MOTIFS

The directory UniqueMotifsScripts contains the tools to calculate the number of unique motifs vs. the number of motifs that are
used in multiple species. The diretory contains a program that outputs a file containing the number of unique motifs and the number
of repeated motifs. These statistics can then be used in Excel or another graph-making software to visually represent the unique
and repeated motifs.

Step 1:

Run makeUniqueMotifsFile.py with the path of the input file as the first argument and the path of the output file
to be created as the second argument. The following command shows an example of how to use this program.

python makeUniqueMotifsFile.py ../mammals mammals_uniqueMotifs.txt

Step 2:

Create a bar graph representing this data in Excel or another graph-making software.
